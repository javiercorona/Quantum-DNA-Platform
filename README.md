# Quantum DNA Platform

A secure, modular platform for encoding, storing, and managing DNA-based digital data using post-quantum cryptography, trusted hardware, and blockchain-backed logging.

## Features

- 🔐 **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Leverages TPM-based sealing, zero-knowledge proofs, and hybrid classical–quantum encryption schemes.
- 🧬 **Biological Encoding Engine**: Supports 2-bit and 3-bit DNA storage modes with GC balancing, homopolymer avoidance, and entropy filtering.
- 📡 **Real-Time Telemetry & WebSockets**: FastAPI-driven APIs with secure streaming for data uploads, mutations, and monitoring.
- 🧾 **Blockchain Logging**: Logs DNA mutation events and transactions to both Substrate-based chains and Polygon for integrity.
- 🗂️ **IPFS Integration**: Fully decentralized content-addressable DNA data storage with CID traceability.
- ⚙️ **Plugin-Governed Microservices**: Modular API structure supporting pluggable governance, token access, and custom logic policies.
- 🔭 **Quantum-Classical Scheduler**: Routes tasks intelligently between classical systems and quantum modules (e.g. QKD or post-quantum mutation analysis).

## Architecture Highlights

- Built with Python 3.11+, FastAPI, NumPy, and TPM interfaces
- Supports DNA compression, mutation modeling, and integrity checks
- Hardened for sovereign, autonomous biological computation environments

## Use Cases

- Secure biological archives
- Quantum-resistant genomic research
- DNA-encoded AI models
- Digital nations with DNA passports or sovereign identity systems
